This is a project for Data Mining at Radboud university. CNN's and an LSTM RNN are applied to the UrbanSound8K dataset. 
The 2D CNN achieves 100% validation accuracy. 
The dataset can be downloaded from <https://www.kaggle.com/chrisfilo/urbansound8k>, and should be located in a folder `data'. On the first run, the notebooks will try to create directories with preprocessed data.
